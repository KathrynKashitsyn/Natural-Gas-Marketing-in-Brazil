# EDA for Brazil Natural Gas Marketing dataset
 
In this notebook, we will do exploratory data analysis and data visualization of Natural Gas Marketing in Brazil, sales of natural gas to local natural gas distribution companies or free consumers authorized by the states to purchase natural gas directly from selling agents. The data contains information on average prices weighted by volumes sold, as well as the volumes sold themselves by year and months.
